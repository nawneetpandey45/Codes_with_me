# Contributing Guidelines

1. **Create a New Branch**:

    - Always create a new branch from the `development` branch.
    - Use a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., `feature/new-feature`, `bugfix/issue-123`).

2. **Commit Changes**:

    - Make sure your commits are clear and concise.
    - Follow the commit message guidelines (e.g., `Add new feature`, `Fix issue with X`).

3. **Create a Pull Request**:

    - Once your changes are ready, create a pull request (PR) targeting the `development` branch.
    - Provide a detailed description of your changes in the PR.

4. **Code Review**:
    - Be responsive to feedback and make necessary changes.
    - Ensure your code passes all tests and adheres to the project's coding standards.
